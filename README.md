# Better Call Saul

Saul Goodman has successfully escaped the ABQ and in his travels is looking back on what might have been. Where else could we have distributed? What region or sub region? What currency did they use?

Thankfully, Walt left behind a small web app to search for such things, unfortunately Jesse didn't respect the computer science and hacked it together with jQuery. Saul needs to add another feature to see where he should set up shop.
